# Unit-9-Pentesting-Live-Targets

# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQLi

-You can inject SQL scripts in the URL, replacing the salesperson id.  This example shows a simple delay, forcing the page to wait 5 seconds before loading.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking

-You can get the session ID of a logged in user through tools like burp or even network inspector.  Can intercept packet in a different browser trying to log in and insert the session ID of the logged in user.


## Green

Vulnerability #1: XSS
![xss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22669092/69834133-5f2e1b80-11ed-11ea-8311-f5a80b308850.gif)

-Can insert script in feedback form, any staff that loads the page to view it will trigger the XSS.


Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration
![userenumeration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22669092/69833574-9995b980-11e9-11ea-8869-e485c38b8795.gif)

-If the username exists, the test for unsuccessful login is bold, if the username doesn't exist, the text is not bold.


## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR
![IDOR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22669092/69833678-42441900-11ea-11ea-8313-6bae91950560.gif)

-Replace salesman ID with a value that doesn't appear when clicking available options, like 10 or 11. These pages exist but aren't available through any clicks on the site.

Vulnerability #2: CSRF
![csrf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22669092/69834381-d912d480-11ee-11ea-9b26-3f4ad0b3274d.gif)

-When editing a salesperson's information, the CSRF token isn't actually checked for validity, and the information can be edited even with an obviously invalid token.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

-I couldn't get the session hijack to work, so I tried recording it to show someone else and see if they could find where I might be getting something wrong, and it suddenly worked while I was recording it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

-I couldn't get my specific XSS entry to show up on Mirror 1, I think someone set theirs to infinitely loop.  Did it on Mirror 2 instead and it worked fine.
