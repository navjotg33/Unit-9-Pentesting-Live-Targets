# Unit-9-Pentesting-Live-Targets

# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQLi

  -You can inject SQL scripts in the URL, replacing the salesperson id.  This example shows a simple delay, forcing the page to wait 5 seconds before loading.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking

-You can get the session ID of a logged in user through tools like burp or even network inspector.  Can intercept packet in a different browser trying to log in and insert the session ID of the logged in user.
