# Unit-9-Pentesting-Live-Targets

# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQLi

-You can inject SQL scripts in the URL, replacing the salesperson id.  This example shows a simple delay, forcing the page to wait 5 seconds before loading.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking

-You can get the session ID of a logged in user through tools like burp or even network inspector.  Can intercept packet in a different browser trying to log in and insert the session ID of the logged in user.


## Green

Vulnerability #1: XSS
![xss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22669092/69833473-f04ec380-11e8-11ea-80c0-5f2d212a4c97.gif)

-Can insert script in feedback form, any staff that loads the page to view it will trigger the XSS.


Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration

-If the username exists, the test for unsuccessful login is bold, if the username doesn't exist, the text is not bold.


## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR

-Replace salesman ID with a value that doesn't appear when clicking available options, like 10 or 11. These pages exist but aren't available through any clicks on the site.

Vulnerability #2: CSRF
